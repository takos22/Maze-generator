# Maze generator

This is my python implementation of the [Aldous-Broder maze generation algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Aldous-Broder_algorithm).

## Demo

This is one of the many mazes generated, it can be found in [``grid.json``](./grid.json).

Run:

pip install pipenv
pipenv install
